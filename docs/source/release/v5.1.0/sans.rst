Algorithms and instruments
--------------------------

Bug Fixed
#########

- Applying a mask to a range of spectra after cropping to a bank could fail
  if there were gaps in the spectrum numbers. The masking will now skip
  over any spectrum numbers not in workspace and emit a warning.
- :ref:`SANSILLReduction <algm-SANSILLIntegration>` could fail if the detector was
  not aligned with the beam. The integration will now use another algorithm in this case.

ISIS SANS Interface
-------------------

Fixed
#####

- A bug has been fixed where processing old data could fail if it involves -add files produced from 2013 or earlier.

:ref:`Release 5.1.0 <v5.1.0>`
