IMPORTANT READ THIS BEFORE EDITING about.ui

There are a couple of bugs in QtDesigner and dynamic loading of .ui files that need special attention here.

Avoiding Font size warnings
===========================
After saving the .ui file in QtDesigner it mistakenly includes an invalid value for the font sizes of most of
the controls.  For this form the font sizes are all overriden in the stylesheets, but a point size of -1 is 
entered in the file and this will cause a warning whenever the form is opened.

The solution here is to open the ui file in a text editor after saving from Qt Designer and change the  font 
sizes from -1 to another valid value e.g. 10.  This makes no difference as the font vales are overriden in 
stylesheets but it suppresses the warnings.

Find all instances of 

<pointsize>-1</pointsize>

and replace them with

<pointsize>10</pointsize>

Seeing the images in Qt Designer AND REMOVING THEM AFTERWARDS
=============================================================
So when you have the resources file linked into the .ui file them dynamic loading of the file will fail.
This is not needed in the workbench as the resources are already loaded on startup before the form is loaded.
If you leave the resource file link in the ui file you will see an error like this:

The solution is to remove the resources file from the .ui file, however that removes all of the images and 
makes it very hard to work with the file in Qt Designer as this dialog has a lot of images.  So here are 
the instructions to both add and remove again the resource file.  Make sure you remeber to remove it before 
committing the file, or trying to start workbench (also don't forget the font size edit above).

Adding the reource file to see the images
-----------------------------------------
1. open about.ui in Qt Designer
2. Select the Resource Browser in the botton right corner
3. Click the pencil icon "Edit Resources"
4. Click the middle icon under the left hand box "Open Resource File"
5. Enter [root]\qt\applications\workbench\resources.qrc
6. All of the images should be added to the window

Removing the resources file THIS MUST BE DONE BEFORE SAVING
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Select the Resource Browser in the botton right corner
2. Click the pencil icon "Edit Resources"
3. Select resources.qrc in the left hand box
4. Click the third icon (x) under the left hand box. "Remove"
5. Click Ok
6. The images should disappear from the window

 <resources>
  <include location="../../../resources.qrc"/>
 </resources>
